Usage: gs abort [flags]

Abort an interrupted operation

Cancels an ongoing git-spice operation that was interrupted by a git rebase or
git merge. For example, if 'gs upstack restack' encounters a conflict, cancel
the operation with 'gs abort', going back to the state before the operation.

The command works with both rebase and merge operations, automatically detecting
which one is in progress.
