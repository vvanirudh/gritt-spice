Usage: gs continue [flags]

Continue an interrupted operation

Continues an ongoing git-spice operation interrupted by a git rebase or git
merge after all conflicts have been resolved. For example, if 'gs upstack
restack' gets interrupted because a conflict arises during the restack, you can
resolve the conflict and run 'gs continue' to continue the operation.

The command works with both rebase and merge operations, automatically detecting
which one is in progress.

Use the --no-edit flag to continue without opening an editor. Make --no-edit the
default by setting 'spice.continue.edit' to false and use --edit to override it.

Flags:
  --[no-]edit    Whether to open an editor to edit the commit message.

      --restack-method="rebase"    Method to use for restacking (rebase or
